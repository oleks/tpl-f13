\section{Conclusion}

The undecidability of the associative property puts a bound on it's
theoretical, but not necessarily practical feasibility.

We have looked into mutliple methods for deciding associativity. Only one of
these methods is applicable to L0 programs in general. The cost is loss of
soundness, i.e. functions may be deemed associative when they in fact ar not.
Other methods are sound (no false positives), but constrained to a rather
mundane subset of the L0 language. These methods also do not in general allow
for the function in question to use other user-defined functions, unless these
functions can be efficiently inlined.

The techniques presented in this paper are by no means constrained to L0. They
are aplicable to all languages with similar semantics.
