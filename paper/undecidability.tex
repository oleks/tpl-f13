\section{Undecidability}\label{section:undecidability}

Undecidability of the property is proven similar to the halting problem.

\begin{proof} We construct a binary Turing machine (TM) $M$ that takes as input
a pair of values $x,y\in S$.

Assume there exists a TM $A$, that given an binary TM $M$, accepts if $M$ is
associative, and rejects otherwise. That is, $A$ is a decider for the
associativity problem.

We construct $M$ such that it returns $x$ if $A(M)$ accepts, and a constant
$z\in S$ otherwise:

\[M\p{x,y} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} x & \text{if $A(M)$} \\ z &
\text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.\]

If $A(M)$ accepts, $M$ is not associative, if $A(M)$ rejects, $M$ is
associative, which contradicts our assumptions about $A$. \end{proof}
