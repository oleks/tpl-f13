\section{Normalization}

The straight-forward way of testing associativity is by replacement and
normalization. We can test whether $\oplus$ is associative by considering
whether $\p{x \oplus y} \oplus z$ is semantically equivalent to $x \oplus \p{y
\oplus z}$.

For instance, if $\oplus\p{x,y} = x\cdot c + y \cdot c$, for some constant
$c\in S$, we consider whether the following equality holds for all $x$, $y$,
and $z$:

\begin{align*}
x\cdot c + \p{y\cdot c + z\cdot c}\cdot c &= \p{x\cdot c + y\cdot c}\cdot c + z\cdot c \\
x\cdot c + y\cdot c^2 + z\cdot c^2 &= x\cdot c^2 + y\cdot c^2 + z\cdot c \\
x\cdot c + z\cdot c^2 &= x\cdot c^2 + z\cdot c
\end{align*}

This holds for all $x$, $y$, and $z$ only if $\card{c}=1$.

This technique requires the rewriting of arbitrary program text into some
normal form that subsequently allows equality comparison of program text.
