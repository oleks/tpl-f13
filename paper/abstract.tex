\abstract{In the context of parallelizable second-order array combinators, it
is often necessary for the function argument to be an associative function.  We
describe a partial decider for the associative property of functions in the
language L0, for implementation in the parallelizing compiler l0c, developed
under the HIPERFIT project. The problem is undecidable in general. This paper
explores the practical feasibility of such a decider in the context of function
arguments to second-order array combinators.}
