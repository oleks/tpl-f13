\abstract{In the context of parallelizable second-order reduction combinators,
it is often necessary for the function argument to be an associative function.
We descibe an effective partial decider of the associative property for
functions in the parallelizing compiler L0, develped under the HIPERFIT
project. The problem is undecidable in general. This paper explores the
practical feasibility of such a decider in the context of function arguments to
second-order reduction combinators.}
