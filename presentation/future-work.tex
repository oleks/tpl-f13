We may consider binary addition as a ternary bitwise operation with an extra,
carry bit:

\[f : \set{0,1} \times \set{0,1} \times \set{0,1} \rightarrow \set{0,1} \times
\set{0,1},\]

and

\[f\p{x,y,c}=\p{\p{x \oplus y} \oplus c, \p{x \wedge y} \vee \p{ \p{ x \vee y}
\wedge c}}.\]

Recall that we said that a homomorphic ternary function was associative in the
first two arguments iff

\[\forall\ x,y,z,c\in S\ .\ f\p{f\p{x,y,c}, z,c} = f\p{x, f\p{y,z,c},c}.\]

We can apply Light's test where we set the carry bit to be first 0, then 1, if
the function is associative in both cases, it is associative in general.

Care must be taken when there are multiple carry-based operations in a function
body.

Better \LMIN and \LMAX rules would've also been nice.
